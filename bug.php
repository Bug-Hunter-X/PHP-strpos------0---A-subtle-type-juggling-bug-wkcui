This code suffers from a subtle bug related to PHP's type juggling and loose comparison.  The `strpos()` function returns `false` if the needle is not found, but `false` also evaluates to 0 in loose comparisons. This can lead to unexpected behavior.

```php
<?php
$haystack = 'This is a test string.';
$needle = 'test';

if (strpos($haystack, $needle) == 0) {
  echo 'Needle found at the beginning!';
} else {
  echo 'Needle not found at the beginning.';
}

$haystack = 'This is a test string.';
$needle = 'notfound';

if (strpos($haystack, $needle) == 0) {
  echo 'Needle found at the beginning!';
} else {
  echo 'Needle not found at the beginning.';
}
?>
```
